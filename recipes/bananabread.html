        <h1>Banana Bread</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A quick and easy home style loaf of banana bread. Feel free to use either ap, white wheat, or whole wheat flour in this recipe. For a lighter crumb use ap and white sugar. But for something heartier use the wheat and brown sugar. If using whole wheat just be sure prior to baking to let the batter sit for thirty minutes. This will allow the flour to hydrate.</p>

        <p><em>Keep in mind this is a very wet dough. But don't fret! Banana bread is a very forgiving bake. So don't be afraid to experiment a little with it. If adding mix-ins use about half a cup.</em></p>

        <p><em>I'm using a nine inch loaf pan but it works just fine in slightly smaller or slightly bigger pans.</em></p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>5 large ripe bananas</li>
            <li>2 cups of ap flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs at room temp</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar <em>(white or brown)</em></li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla paste or extract</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ginger</li>
            <li>1 tsp nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp of butter (for pan)</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 F/162 C.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl mash up those bananas. Feel free to use a fork or a food processor or blender.</li>
            <li>Combine the eggs, vanilla, and vegetable oil into the bananas.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl combine the remaining dry ingredients. Stir together thoroughly to ensure everybody gets to known each other.</li>
            <li>Begin to add your dry mix to the bananas. Do so in batches to ensure it's well combined. If you have mix-ins fold them into the batter.</li>
            <li>Butter the pan thoroughly. Get in all the nooks and crannies. To add an optional crunch coat the sides of the pan with white or turbinado sugar.</li>
            <li>Bake in oven for 55-65 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Let cool in pan for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>

        </ol>
